 - 2 cups all-purpose flour
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 1/4 teaspoon baking powder

  4. Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined well. 
  5. Gradually add flour mixture, beating until mixture just forms a dough.
  6. Divide dough between 2 large sheets of wax paper and form each half into a 10- x 1 1/2-inch log, wrapping it in wax paper. 
  7. Chill logs until firm, at least 4 hours, and up to 5 days. Dough may be frozen, wrapped in foil, 2 months. 
  8. Let dough soften slightly before cutting.
